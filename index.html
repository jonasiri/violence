      <h1> Welcome to the game violence page</h1>
      <p> This is where we will take you through the evolution of game violence. How man has come to be such a violent creature, through the process of gaming. </p>
      <h2> Introduction </h2>
      <p> Before the advent of video games, the human race was a kind and peaceful one. However, in the 200 years since their invention, the atrocities commited by man have only worsened. The effects of those games were long thought to be negligible, if not completely invented. But as society grew more violent, things became more apparent.
      </p>
      <p> You will need to work hard to investigate how the downfall of the human race came to happen through the development of video games. This project will help illustrate how one group can suppress information, and cause the collapse of an entire civilisation, or even race.
